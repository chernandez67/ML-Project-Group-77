# Introduction/Background

With the rise of artwork generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E and Midjourney, it raises an interesting question about influences from source material. Generative art models are trained on large datasets including works from different art movements over time. Our team seeks to develop a solution for classifying an art piece into a stylistic period. This categorization algorithm could be used to identify and retrace the art styles mimicked in generative art. Previous approaches have used k-Nearest Neighbor and support vector machine algorithms to build their models (Falomir, Zoe, et al.).

# Problem definition
Given an image our project aims to classify the style of an art piece. Our goal is to create a model that consistently classifies the style of the images in any collection.

# Methods
Explain the content of the dataset and methods

### Preprocessing
Explain the preprocessing steps including feature reduction
