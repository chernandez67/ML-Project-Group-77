# Introduction/Background

With the rise of artwork generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E and Midjourney, it raises an interesting question about influences from source material. Generative art models are trained on large datasets including works from different art movements over time. Our team seeks to develop a solution for classifying an art piece into a stylistic period. This categorization algorithm could be used to identify and retrace the art styles mimicked in generative art. Previous approaches have used k-Nearest Neighbor and support vector machine algorithms to build their models (Falomir, Zoe, et al.).

# Problem definition
Given an image our project aims to classify the style of an art piece. Our goal is to create a model that consistently classifies the style of the images in any collection.

# Methods
_What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Methods may change when you start implementing them which is fine). Students are encouraged to use existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) instead of coding the algorithms from scratch._

# Potential results and discussion
_(The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics)._
