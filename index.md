# Introduction/Background

_A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. You can briefly explain your dataset and its features here too._

# Problem definition
_Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?_

# Methods
_Based on our choice of dataset, we already have potential predefined clusters, such as Artist, Artistic Movement, or time period. As a result, we can apply different unsupervised learning techniques to the full data set with a known number of clusters to see if different clustering algorithms assign each image correctly. Scikit Learn provides many algorithms already that we can use to perform this analysis. A very common technique in supervised learning for images is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks._

# Potential results and discussion
_(The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics)._

# Proposed timeline
_Add proposed timeline from start to finish and list each project members’ responsibilities. Fall and Spring semester sample Gantt Chart. This part does NOT count towards word limit._

# Contribution table
_A contribution table with all group members’ names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task. This part does NOT count towards word limit._

| Name               | Contribution |

| Abdullah Ahmed     | Tech Lead |
| Alec Albrecht      | Methods and Algorithms |
| Carlos Hernandez   | Project Manager |
| Ankita Somu        | Data Scientist |

# References
_At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit._
