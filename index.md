# Introduction/Background

_A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. You can briefly explain your dataset and its features here too._

# Problem definition
_Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?_

# Methods
_What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Methods may change when you start implementing them which is fine). Students are encouraged to use existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) instead of coding the algorithms from scratch._

# Potential results and discussion
_(The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics)._

# Proposed timeline
_Add proposed timeline from start to finish and list each project members’ responsibilities. Fall and Spring semester sample Gantt Chart. This part does NOT count towards word limit._

# Contribution table
_A contribution table with all group members’ names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task. This part does NOT count towards word limit._

| Name               | Contribution |

| Alec Albrecht      | Contribution |
| Carlos Hernandez   | Contribution |
| Ankita Somu        | Contribution |
| Sanjana Srinivasan | Contribution |

# References
_At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit._
