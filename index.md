# Introduction/Background

With the rise of artwork generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E and Midjourney, it raises an interesting question about influences from source material. Generative art models are trained on large datasets including works from different art movements over time. Our team seeks to develop a solution for classifying an art piece into a stylistic period. This categorization algorithm could be used to identify and retrace the art styles mimicked in generative art. Previous approaches have used k-Nearest Neighbor and support vector machine algorithms to build their models (Falomir, Zoe, et al.).

# Problem definition
Given an image our project aims to classify the style of an art piece. Our goal is to create a model that consistently classifies the style of the images in any collection.

# Methods
_Based on our choice of dataset, we already have potential predefined clusters, such as Artist, Artistic Movement, or time period. As a result, we can apply different unsupervised learning techniques to the full data set with a known number of clusters to see if different clustering algorithms assign each image correctly. Scikit Learn provides many algorithms already that we can use to perform this analysis. A very common technique in supervised learning for images is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks._

# Potential results and discussion
_(The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics)._
